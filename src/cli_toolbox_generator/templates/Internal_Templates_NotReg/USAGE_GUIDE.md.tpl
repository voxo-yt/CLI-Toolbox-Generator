# Project Structure

Your generated project is organized as follows:

```

│
├── menus/                        ← Auto-generated menu classes
│    ├── <root_name>_menu.py    ← Root menu (named after your root menu)
│    ├── ...submenus...           ← Child menus based on your menu tree
│
├── ui/
│    └── ui_manager.py            ← Header, formatting, tables, pause helpers

# Running the CLI

From the project root:

```
python main.py
```

The CLI automatically loads your menu tree and uses the UI manager for consistent formatting.

---

# Menu System

Each menu is represented by its own class:

```python
class ExampleMenu:
    def display(self):
        # Renders header + options
        ...

    def handle(self):
        # Routes selection to command handlers
        ...
```

Commands follow the generated pattern:

```python
def cmd_do_something(self):
    # TODO: implement this command
    ...
```

---

# UI Utilities (UIManager)

Every menu has access to a shared `UIManager` instance:

```python
self.ui.header("Title")
self.ui.clear()
self.ui.pause()
self.ui.line()
self.ui.print_kv("Label", "Value")
```

---

# Selectors: Single & Multi-Pick

Arrow‑key navigation is built-in:

### Single-select
```python
choice = select("Pick one:", ["Option A", "Option B"])
```

### Multi-select
```python
choices = multi_select("Pick all that apply:", ["A", "B", "C"])
```

---

# Included QoL Plugins

{{plugin_docs}}

All plugins live in the `plugins/` directory.  
If you enabled additional plugin modules during generation, they appear here.

---

# Extending the CLI

To expand your CLI:

1. **Add a new menu**  
   Create a `.py` file in `menus/` and follow any generated menu class.

2. **Add new commands**  
   Add new `cmd_*` methods inside the appropriate menu file.

3. **Add custom helpers**  
   Place reusable modules in `utilities/` or `plugins/`.

4. **Modify UI appearance**  
   Edit `ui/ui_manager.py` for global formatting changes.
